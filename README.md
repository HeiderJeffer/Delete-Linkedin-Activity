## What

Scripts for automated deletion of Linkedin activity.

**Disclaimer: these scripts will ruthlessly delete ALL your Linkedin activity. They were made for that. Use at your own risk.**

## Why

As of now, Linkedin doesn't offer a _bulk-delete_ option for personal activity. There's also no API available for that.  

## How

Use the scripts provided here to delete posts, comments and likes:

1. open your web browser;
2. go to the correct Linkedin page (see below);
3. open the browser's JavaScript console;
4. paste the corresponding script in the JavaScript console;
5. execute it!
